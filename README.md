This is a repository storing answers to assignment 1, questions 1-8 for Data 221. 

File 1: Contains code for a multiplcation loop for a number to be continously multiplied by a number increasing by one for each loop, until it is equal to or greater than a target number.

File 2: Contains code to transform a list of strings into a dictionary. Where the keys are the each individual strings and the values are data taken from each string (i.e. length and parity)

File 3: This is a file containing code that takes in a list of pairing numbers (x,y). It removes the one with a negative value y and then inputs the data as x^y. Then outputing the data organized in a list and prints it.

File 4: Contains code that creates a list of 20 values from random values and a x variable with the same randomness. Then sorts the list to remove all the values that are lower than the x variable.

File 5: This file contains code for a function that takes the radii of two circles, confirms that the input radii are positive integers, computes the area of each circle and returns the percentage of the larger circles area that is covered by the smaller circle. 

File 6: Contains code for a functions that recieves a list of numbers and returns a dictionary where a the keys are the values from the list, and the values is the percentage of elements in the same list than are less than or equal to that key. Sorting the dictionary and returning it after. 

File 7: This file contains code for a function that takes in a integer representing seconds after midnight. Then returns a string with the correct time in hours, minutes, seconds and AM or PM. 

File 8: The last file of this repositiory has pandas installed and is used to create a data frame from a dictionary. Along with adding a column from existing columns and printed.
